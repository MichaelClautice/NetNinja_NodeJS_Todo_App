# NetNinja_NodeJS_Todo_App
This project was created after watching the tutorials of The Nen Ninja.

This is a repository which contains a basic node web api. The project was created by following the tutorial, in order to have quick access of a functional (hopefully) working version.

The tutorial is availabe here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-7RQ46RgxU&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gcy9lrvMJ75z9maRw4byYp
